# Cyberdeck-QEMU-Emulator
Emulating my cyberdeck hardware so I can develop a bespoke OS bare metal style.

I have a pi zero w2 and a 2.13" b/w e ink display and some other hardware (USB hub; battery; mechanical keyboard),
which I need to emulate so I can rapidly develop a bare metal OS, for it.
ChatGPT will be helping me, so its a real blind leading the blind situation, wish me luck!

My design goals for this project are to emulate the hardware, and then run a couple tests to make sure I'm actually emulating the hardware.

This repository is part of a 3 repository project.
